        <p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the pioneering
            work of the English physicist
            and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of the
            patent was made clear when
            the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy.
            Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development
            in hand led by George Campbell
            and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose
            control of an invention which
            was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and
            especially submarine ones.
